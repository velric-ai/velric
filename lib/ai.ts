You are an expert career coach and technical mentor who creates realistic, engaging coding missions based on actual industry scenarios. Generate a comprehensive mission that feels like a real project from a top-tier company.

CONTEXT:
- User Background: {userBackground}

- Industry Focus: {industry}
- Difficulty Level: {difficulty}
- Time Estimate: {timeEstimate}

REQUIREMENTS:
Generate a single, detailed mission with the following structure. Make it as comprehensive and detailed as the example missions you might find at companies like Google, Meta, or top startups.

MISSION OUTPUT (JSON):
{
  "title": "Engaging, specific mission title that sounds like a real company project (e.g., 'Build AI-Powered Code Review Assistant' or 'Design Microservices Architecture for E-commerce Platform')",
  "description": "Detailed 3-4 sentence description explaining the scenario, business impact, technical challenges, and what the user will accomplish. Include specific metrics or business goals.",
  "field": "Primary field (e.g., 'Frontend Development', 'Backend Engineering', 'Full Stack', 'Data Science', 'DevOps', 'Mobile Development', 'AI/ML Engineering')",
  "difficulty": "Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced",
  "timeEstimate": "Realistic time estimate matching complexity (e.g., '4-6 hours', '2-3 days', '1-2 weeks')",
  "category": "Specific category (e.g., 'Web Development', 'API Design', 'Data Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'System Architecture')",
  "company": "Realistic company name that fits the industry (can be fictional but sounds authentic)",
  "context": "Detailed 4-5 sentence background explaining: the company's current situation, specific business constraints, why this project is critical now, what happens if it's not completed, and how it fits into broader company goals. Include specific numbers, deadlines, or business metrics.",
  "skills": ["6-8 specific technical skills needed, ranging from languages to frameworks to tools"],
  "industries": ["2-3 relevant industries this mission applies to"],
  "tasks": [
    "Minimum 5-7 specific, actionable tasks that the user must complete. Each task should be:
    - Specific and measurable (e.g., 'Implement JWT authentication with 2FA support' not 'Add authentication')
    - Include technical details (e.g., 'Design database schema with proper indexing for 1M+ users')
    - Have clear deliverables (e.g., 'Create comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI 3.0 spec')
    - Build progressively in complexity
    - Include testing, documentation, and deployment aspects"
  ],
  "objectives": [
    "3-4 clear, specific learning objectives that align with career growth:
    - Technical skills the user will master
    - Industry best practices they'll learn
    - Real-world experience they'll gain
    - Career-relevant competencies they'll develop"
  ],
  "resources": [
    "4-6 realistic resources/tools/constraints available:
    - Specific datasets, APIs, or services (e.g., 'Access to Stripe API sandbox environment')
    - Tools and platforms (e.g., 'AWS credits for cloud infrastructure')
    - Sample code or existing systems (e.g., 'Legacy codebase with 50K+ lines to refactor')
    - Team support (e.g., 'Senior architect available for weekly code reviews')
    - Documentation and guidelines (e.g., 'Company's microservices architecture patterns')
    - Realistic constraints (e.g., 'Must maintain 99.9% uptime during migration')"
  ],
  "evaluationMetrics": [
    "4-6 specific, measurable criteria for evaluating success:
    - Performance benchmarks (e.g., 'API response time under 200ms for 95% of requests')
    - Quality standards (e.g., 'Code coverage above 85% with integration tests')
    - Business metrics (e.g., 'Reduce user onboarding time by 40%')
    - Technical requirements (e.g., 'Handle 10K concurrent users without degradation')
    - Security standards (e.g., 'Pass OWASP security scan with zero high-risk vulnerabilities')
    - User experience metrics (e.g., 'Mobile app receives 4.5+ star rating in testing')"
  ]
}

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. COMPANY CONTEXT MUST BE URGENT AND SPECIFIC: Include real business pressures like "Series B funding requires 10x user growth in 6 months" or "Compliance audit in 8 weeks requires GDPR implementation"

2. TASKS MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE: Each task should feel like a real sprint story with acceptance criteria. Include setup, implementation, testing, documentation, and deployment phases.

3. TECHNICAL DEPTH: Match the difficulty level - Beginner tasks focus on fundamentals, Advanced tasks involve system design, scalability, and complex integrations.

4. BUSINESS IMPACT: Every mission should clearly articulate why this work matters to the company's success, with specific metrics or deadlines.

5. REAL-WORLD CONSTRAINTS: Include realistic limitations like legacy system integration, budget constraints, regulatory requirements, or technical debt.

EXAMPLES OF EXCELLENT COMPANY CONTEXTS:
- "StreamingCorp's video platform crashes during peak hours (8-10 PM), losing $50K/hour in ad revenue. The current CDN can't handle 2M concurrent users, and a major sports event next month will triple traffic."
- "FinTechStart must implement PCI compliance before their Series A investor due diligence in 6 weeks, or risk losing $10M funding. Current payment processing stores sensitive data insecurely."
- "HealthcareAI's patient data pipeline processes 500K records daily but takes 6 hours to complete, delaying critical treatment decisions. Doctors need real-time insights to improve patient outcomes."

Generate a mission that reads like it came from a real company's high-priority project backlog, with the depth and detail of actual enterprise software development.
